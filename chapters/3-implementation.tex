\section{System Architecture Overview}
\subsection{FASRC Algorithm}
The \acrfull{fasrc} is the main algorithm in the implementation.
% flow diagram of the algorithm
% input signal -> [Find new time instant] -> [Calculate value for new time isntant] <- [coefficients] -> output signal


% algorithm for calculating the new time instants
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{\acrshort{fasrc} algorithm flow}\label{alg:main}
\begin{algorithmic}
\State \textbf{procedure} FASRC(input signal x, output signal y)
\State $coeff\_order \gets \text{length of } coeffs$
    \State $input\_period \gets 1 / fs\_in$
    \State $output\_period \gets 1 / fs\_out$
    \State $output\_length \gets \lceil \text{length of } input\_signal \times fs\_out / fs\_in \rceil$
    \State $output\_signal \gets \text{array of zeros of size } output\_length$
    \For{$samples$ \textbf{in} $output_signal$}
        \State $t_k \gets sample\_idx \times output\_period$
        \State $n \gets \lfloor t_k / input\_period \rfloor$
        \State $delta\_t \gets t_k - n \times input\_period$
        \State $offset \gets \text{round}(delta\_t / input\_period)$
        \For{$m \gets 0$ \textbf{to} $coeff\_order - 1$}
            \If{$0 \leq n + m < \text{length of } input\_signal$}
                \State $output\_signal[sample\_idx] \mathrel{{+}{=}} coeffs[m] \times input\_signal[n + m]$
            \EndIf
        \EndFor
    \EndFor
    \State \textbf{return} y
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}



\subsection{Filter Design}
FIR filter was used to calculate the coefficients for use in 
%A useful rule for implementing FIR filters is that out-of-band side-lobe levels are bounded by 5 dB per bit. Thus, if we design an FIR filter with minimum side-lobe attenuation of 72 dB, we must represent the finite length coefficient set with at least 15 bits


\subsubsection{Window design}
% why use hamming?
% why not other filters


\subsection{Lagrange Coefficient Design}
% describe the process
% Cite the theory section

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Lagrange Coefficient Calculation}\label{alg:main}
\begin{algorithmic}
\State \textbf{procedure} LagrangeCoeffs(time instant \textit{t}, input sampling interval \textit{T}, interpolation order \textit{N}):
\State $coefficients[] \gets \textbf{1}$
\For {$i = 1, 2, \ldots, N$}
\For {$l = 1, 2, \ldots, N$}
\If {$i \neq l$}

\State $coefficients[i] \gets coefficients[i] \cdot \frac{t - l \cdot T}{i \cdot T - l \cdot T}$
\EndIf
\EndFor
\EndFor
\State \Return $coefficients[]$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{High-level implementation}
% used python to implement in high order implementation
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_description
% why high level implementation
Implementing a algorithm in a high-level language gives an understanding of how the algorithm works and how to quantize it in a abstract way. Python was chosen as the high-level language due to the compatibility with PYNQ, making it easier to compare results and effiency. Python have a range of libraries that can be used to simplify the design process.

\subsection{Packages}
% Numpy for array manipulation
Different python packages were used to design the algorithm in: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Numpy} was used for array manipulation.
    \item \textit{Scipy} provided capability for signal processing and design of the \acrshort{fir} filter coefficients.
    \item \textit{matplotlib} was used to plot the signals.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Design process}
% functions and modules
% describe the functions and modules used in the implementation
% describe the usage of float and int32
% edge padding for lagrange method

% fasrc algorithm
\subsubsection{Main algorithm}
% Describe the fasrc function and the chooses made


\subsubsection{Filter coefficients}
\textit{Scipy.signal.firwin} function was used to design the \acrshort{fir} filter coefficients. \textit{Firwin} is a function that calculates and returns the coefficients based on number of taps, cutoff frequency and chosen window method.

\subsubsection{Testing}
% what kind of testing was done


\subsubsection{Optimizations}
% what optimizations were made to make the algorithm go faster in python
% do i need to remove flag when testing the different methods?

\subsection{PYNQ}
PYNQ is a platform from AMD that makes test processes a lot easier in conjunction with python. It is based on the jupyter framework, which makes it possible to test designs in a jupyter notebook server. PYNQ supports a range of FPGAs including ZUBoard 1CG.
