\section{Motivation} % Context and Approach
% Introduction to the Sample rate converters
Sample rate converters are highly important in digital signal processing and is used extensively. Sample rate conversion is the process of increasing or decreasing the sample rate of a signal. Systems and devices requires different sampling rates and conversion is therefore very much needed. 


% why is this important -> systems energy efficiency
% Sample-rate conversion prevents changes in speed and pitch that would otherwise occur when transferring recorded material between such systems.

% include figure of different devices requiring different sample rate (use draw.io)

% Ratio problem
One aspect of sample rate conversion is 
% arbitrary sample rate converters
% multistage filters
% why making it more efficienly is important

\section{Problem Description}

% somewhat abstract? table perhaps?
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}
% design an arbitrary rate converter 
% requirements
Based on ... three key objectives were created:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement the algorithm and test it in a High-Level programming language.
    \item Make an implementation on a provided FPGA development board.
    \item Use PYNQ to test and demonstrate the result.
\end{enumerate}
% first in high level language
% then in HDL
% then test it on PYNQ


% include a work flow of implementation in HDL?
